# CricketGameEngine

A framework for writing cricket simulations, which is relatively immature at the moment. Currently it will manage the
event order of a cricket game and allow you to report on the status.

The engine is deliberately very light, in order to allow as much flexibility as possible in the implementation. A
simple probability based example is provided by way of an example.
